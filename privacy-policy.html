          <p>
            James Kennedy, P.L.L.C. ("we," "us," or "our") respects your privacy and is committed
            to protecting any personal information you share with us. This Privacy Policy explains
            what information we collect when you visit jameskennedypllc.com (the "Site"), how we use
            that information, and the choices you have. By using the Site, you consent to the data
            practices described below.
          </p>

          <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
          <p>
            We may collect personal information that you voluntarily provide, such as your name,
            phone number, email address, and case details when you complete a contact form, request
            a consultation, or subscribe to updates. We also automatically collect certain technical
            information, including your IP address, browser type, referring pages, and the date and
            time of each visit. This information helps us understand how the Site is used and
            improve its performance.
          </p>

          <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
          <p>
            The information we collect is used to respond to your inquiries, schedule consultations,
            and provide legal marketing communications that may be of interest. We also use data to
            maintain and improve the Site, analyze traffic patterns, and ensure security. We do not
            sell or rent your personal information to third parties.
          </p>

          <h2>Cookies and Tracking Technologies</h2>
          <p>
            The Site uses cookies and similar tracking technologies to recognize your browser,

            We may partner with service providers to host the Site, manage email communications,

            personal information only as necessary to perform their services and are obligated to
            protect your data in accordance with our instructions.

            While we strive to secure your data, please understand that no method of transmission or
            storage is entirely risk-free. If you have reason to believe that your interaction with
            us is no longer secure, contact us immediately using the details below.
          </p>

          <h2>Retention of Information</h2>

            We retain personal information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined
            in this policy and to comply with legal, regulatory, or ethical obligations. When
            information is no longer required, we will delete or anonymize it in a secure manner.
          </p>

          <h2>Your Rights and Choices</h2>
          <p>
            Depending on your location, you may have rights to access, correct, update, or delete the
