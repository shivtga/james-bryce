# James B. Kennedy, Jr. Personal Injury Website

This repository contains a marketing website for attorney James Bryce Kennedy, Jr. The site now
includes a robust multi-page experience featuring a ten-article blog, dedicated privacy policy,
disclaimer, and contact pages, along with a cookie consent banner that appears across the
experience. The home page still highlights his board certification, admissions, practice areas,
and contact information for his El Paso, Texas law office.

## Getting Started

Open `index.html` in any modern web browser. All styling and interactions are handled with the
static assets in `assets/css/styles.css` and `assets/js/main.js`â€”no build step is required. Blog
articles live in the `blog/` directory, and new policy/contact pages are placed at the project
root.
